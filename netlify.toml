# Global settings applied to the whole site.
#
# “publish” is the directory to publish (relative to root of your repo),
# “command” is your build command,
# “base” is directory to change to before starting build. if you set base:
#    that is where we will look for package.json/.nvmrc/etc not repo root!

[build]
  base = "frontend"
  publish = "frontend/dist"
  command = "npm run build"
  environment = { LOAD_ENV = "staging" }

# Production context: All deploys to the main
# repository branch will inherit these settings.
